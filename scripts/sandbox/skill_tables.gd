extends RefCounted
## One active skill per hero, chosen by class (T-009). All numbers are provisional (D-012).
## kind: "target"      damage to the current/nearest enemy within `range`
##       "target_aoe"  damage to every enemy within `radius` of that target
##       "self_aoe"    damage to every enemy within `radius` of the hero
##       "self_heal"   heals the hero for `heal` of max HP
## `mult` multiplies the hero's power (max of ATK/MAG) before DEF mitigation.
## Skills are activated by the player only (key Q / panel button); they are never refused
## randomly. They are refused only when on cooldown or when there is nothing to hit.
