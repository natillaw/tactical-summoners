extends NavMap
## The town (D-030): a fixed, hand-placed map that is always the same. Buildings come from
## TownTables; every built building is solid and its door cell (bottom centre) is walkable.
## Unbuilt plots stay walkable (dirt) so heroes can cross them.

## Ground kinds for drawing: "#" forest edge (trees), "B" building, "p" cobble path, "d" dirt plot,
## "w" well, "." grass.
