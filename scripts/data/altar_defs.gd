## Master prompt E (2026-10-31): the Crimson Baron (floor 10) and his altar. Every number here.
## The Baron is immune to all damage while his shield holds. CHANNEL_HEROES heroes standing on an altar
## channel for CHANNEL_TIME s (any hit on a channeler breaks it) and the shield falls for VULN_TIME s,
## then it comes back. Phases by the Baron's health:
##   above PHASE2_AT: one altar
##   PHASE2_AT..PHASE3_AT: a second altar on the far side; BOTH_REQUIRED = both must be channeled
##   below PHASE3_AT: the altar moves after every vulnerable window

## Subtle hints (no tutorial): a faint thread of light from the Baron to the altar, seen only within
## THREAD_SEEN px of either; a pulsing shield on "0" hits in the altar's rhythm (PULSE_HZ); a fallen
## adventurer with a hand on the altar; one line from a hero (once per attempt).
