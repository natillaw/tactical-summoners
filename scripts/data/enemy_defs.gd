## Creature stats and combat roles (D-056: difficulty from composition, not from inflated health).
## Numbers are tuning placeholders for early floors (heroes of 1-2 stars, level 1-5: ~100-130 HP and
## ~12 damage per second each). Body size (reach, wind-up, mass) comes from CombatRules.SIZE on top.
##
## Roles: swarm = fast and frail, comes in numbers; melee = standard fighter; brute = slow heavy hitter;
## guard = holds a spot (leash) with armour; ranged = strikes from afar and backs off; support = heals
## hurt allies and stays behind them. status = applied to heroes its strike hits ({id, dur, mag}).

## assassin (master prompt D/H) = melee that always hunts the backline (healers, casters) and leaps to it.

## --- tactical targeting (2026-10-31: the Wilds and late floors punish mistakes) ---------------------
## A "tactical" creature (DungeonDefs / floor "tactics") does not just go for the nearest hero: it scores
## every hero it perceives = distance - bonuses. Healers and ranged heroes (the backline) and heroes
## standing alone are worth chasing; frontline roles (guard, brute) stay on the nearest and body-block.

## --- creature classes and skills (D-065) -------------------------------------------------------------
## Roles work as classes: swarm (skirmisher), melee (fighter), brute, guard (defender), ranged (archer),
## support (healer / shaman), plus two jobs given by the floor: scout (lookout: flees to raise the alarm)
## and the boss's shamans. A creature casts a skill like a hero: a visible wind-up (a ring on the caster
## for help spells, the marked area for attacks) that a stun or an interrupt breaks; cooldown per skill.
## min_floor: the skill appears from that floor (floor 1 teaches the basics without enemy healers).
## Targets: ally_low = the most hurt creature in range (heals); ally_key = the boss if near, else the
## strongest creature (wards); allies = every creature around the caster; hero_area = an area at a hero
## (marked on the ground: step out of it).
