## D-066: the repeatable farming dungeon outside the tower (the "Wilds"). It is where the town's
## materials come from: building materials, wood, stone, ore, herbs and creature parts. The tower no
## longer has gathering spots; it drops equipment and rare things the Wilds never give.
##   - A new procedural map every time (it is never saved, unlike tower floors, D-026).
##   - Its tier follows the tower: tier 1 while the squad climbs floors 1-10, tier 2 once floor 10 is
##     cleared, and so on (tier(): 1 + highest cleared floor / 10). Each tier is another biome with its
##     own creatures and loot.
##   - No mission: the squad goes as deep as it dares and leaves by the entrance (X). The further from
##     the entrance, the richer the spots and caches and the harder the creatures. A wiped squad loses
##     everything it carried; fallen heroes die for good (D-011).
## Every number here is a tuning placeholder. Configs use the same keys as TowerExpedition floors so the
## map generator and the mission screen read both alike (TowerExpedition.get_floor_config(-tier)).

## 2026-10-31: the Wilds fight smart (EnemyDefs tactical targeting, anti-blob area aim, callers) and
## their packs are built by role so they complement each other: PACK = the role of each slot in order
## (a tank first, then ranged damage and a healer, then fillers). Roles missing from a tier's foes fall
## back to any foe of the tier.
