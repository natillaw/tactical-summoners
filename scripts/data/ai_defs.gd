## D-082: numbers for the autonomous heroes (layered AI), the ping wheel, revive, the bandits' roles and
## the way each weapon hits. Every value is a tuning placeholder. All randomness that reads these goes
## through the unit's seeded combat_rng (never the global randf) so the coming deterministic core can
## replay a fight.

## dps: sticks to the squad's focus target (pinged / spotted / the one the most heroes hit).
## healer: stays HEALER_BACK px behind the front and keeps healing.
## scout: walks SCOUT_AHEAD px ahead of the Master when calm and keeps SCOUT_KEEP px from foes.

## role spot; delay = extra seconds before it answers a ping or a Command; ignore_retreat_hp = above this

## (more AGI = a quicker rhythm, less FUE) its damage per second stays within ~15 % of a warrior's of the
## same level against an unarmoured foe (tests/smoke_ai.gd checks levels 1, 5 and 10).
