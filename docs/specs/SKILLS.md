# Skill Library

Generated from `tools/gen_skill_library.py` (D-022). Edit the table there, not this file.

Rules: each hero uses **4 actives + 1 ultimate** in battle (chosen from skills unlocked for its class and level). `Lv` is the hero level needed (1-70); `Star` = ceil(level/10) is the star tier that corresponds to it. Skills with `Status: implemented` run in the sandbox today; the rest are specifications for T-031.

## Enemy tags

- `armored`: heavy armor, high DEF
- `swarm`: many weak enemies at once
- `ranged`: archers and throwers
- `caster`: spell users, low DEF
- `boss`: large single targets with lots of HP
- `fast`: quick enemies that close distance
- `flying`: airborne enemies
- `undead`: skeletons and the like
- `beast`: animals and monsters
- `shielded`: enemies with shields or guard stances
- `evasive`: dodgy, hard to pin down
- `brute`: slow heavy hitters
